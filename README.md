# carsim

This is me playing with ammo.js and threejs to attempt a KISS 3D physics car sim


## log
- got everything from https://github.com/kripken/ammo.js
- copied raycast-vehicle-demo into demo1
- created simplest d.ts file
- changed things to const/let and dropped unused vars
- adding heightmap terrain from terrain demo


## reference

- [threejs docs](https://threejs.org/docs/)
- bullet docs [1](https://pybullet.org/Bullet/BulletFull/), [2](https://github.com/bulletphysics/bullet3/blob/master/docs/Bullet_User_Manual.pdf)
